<div class="h1"><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1></div>

<div class="h3"> <h3>What do you need to make bread?</h3></div>
<p>You don't need a whole lot to make bread! Mixing bowls are a valuable tool in order to combine both wet and dry ingredients. 
    Stand mixers, while useful for kneading dough, are not necessary if you're willing to get your hands dirty.
    Having a scale to measure ingredients is worth buying, and a wire cooling rack is also a useful tool to let your bread rest after backing.
    Dutch ovens and proofing trays are also tools to invest in if you're serious about your breadmaking journey, but aren't wholly necessary to get started.

<div class="h3"> <h3>What is a sourdough starter?</h3></div>
<p>
    Sourdough starters are a mixture of yeasts and bacteria that are used to leaven bread and add additional flavor. They're also known as levain or leavaning.
    Sourdough breads usually begin with sourdough starters, which are a mixture of flour, water, yeast, and bacteria. This yeast helps the dough rise.
    Unfortunately, sourdough starters may need maintenance in order to keep its leavening properties. Stirring it will add oxygen and let the yeast reproduce.

<div class="h3"> <h3>What is proofing? How long does dough take to proof?</h3></div>
<p>Proofing is the process in which bread dough rises and is the final step in fermentation. Different types of bread require different amounts of time to proof.
    Proofing time is usually stated in a recipe, but eyeballing the volume of the dough is the best way to determine if a dough is done proofing. 
    This requires experience, so don't be afraid to have a few tries go wrong while you're figuring it out! Fully fermented dough will usually be doubled in size.
    Air bubbles appearing in the dough usually mean a dough is overproofed. If you keep clear plastic wrap covering your proofing vessel, it'll be easier to monitor how large the dough is getting.
</p>
<div class="h3"> <h3>How can you tell when your bread is done baking?</h3></div>
<p>While most recipes will give you an oven temperature and amount of time to bake bread, every oven is different and you may find that your bread is over or underbacked when following the recipe.
    Fully baked breads will have a golden brown crust, and you can further test doneness by tapping the bottom of your bread loaf. A clear sound will indicate that your bread is ready, while a duller sound indicates that your bread needs longer in the oven.
    Freshly baked bread will also have a distinct smell, so you can use your nose to determine when your bread is done!
</p>
<div class="h3"> <h3>How can I store my bread? How long does freshly baked bread last?</h3></div>
<p>Fresh bread should be kept at room temperature in a dry environment. It will last a couple of days in this state.
    If you need to keep your bread for longer, you can slice them and wrap the slices in plastic wrap and place them in the freezer. 
    They will last several months this way, and you can take out individual slices and defrost them at room temperature before toasting for consumption.
