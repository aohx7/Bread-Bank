    This challah bread recipe is perfect for parties or other special occasions. The inclusion of eggs in the dough adds some extra richness! The dough can be braided similar to hair, so different styles and patterns can be achieved depending on what look you want to go for.
    Try out a circular braid, or braid with multiple "strands" for the best results! Make sure to leave some room in the oven so that the challah has room to grow.

   Pretzels are a great snack for movie night, or just every day. Invite your friends over for a pretzel party! Pretzels can be made fun with a variety of different dips.
   Nacho cheese is a common one- you can also add sliced jalapenos for a bit of a spicy kick. Sweet pretzels are also a good idea- just sprinkle in cinnamon sugar!
