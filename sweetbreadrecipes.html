    <h1>Croissant Recipe</h1>
    
<div class="h2"><h2>Ingredients</h2></div>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups of whole milk</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>
<div class="h2"><h2>Instructions</h2></div>
<ol>
    <li>Cut butter into 1 tablespoon pieces. Add butter, flour, sugar, salt, and yeast into an electric mixer and combine ingredients.</li>
    <li>Pour in the milk with the mixer running and beat the dough for 5 minutes. Remove dough from mixer and work into a ball.</li>
    <li>Flatten dough onto baking sheet and place in the refrigerator to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and flatten out the dough with your hands. Place dough back onto the baking sheet and place in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
    <li>Beat butter and flour together until combined. Transfer mixture to a baking mat and smooth into a 7 x 10" rectangle. Place baking sheet in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place dough layer onto counter. Place butter layer in the center of the dough layer. Fold each end of the dough over the butter layer.</li>
    <li>Roll the dough into a 10 x 20" rectangle. Make sure the dough and butter layers stay chilled. If not, refrigerate until chilled. </li>
    <li>Repeat lamination process three times and place into refrigerator overnight.</li>
    <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator. Slice the dough in half twice, creating 16 triangles. Using a rolling pin, gently roll the triangles to not flatten the layers.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Whisk egg and whole milk together to create egg wash. Brush egg wash on top of the croissants.</li>
    <li>Bake croissants for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove after they are done baking.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

    Croissants are a challenging bread to bake- even professionals have trouble with them sometimes! The trick to making croissants is to make sure that all the layers are cold.
    When rolling, always be gentle so that the layers are allowed to grow. If you're struggling, you can choose to use premade puff pastry instead of going through the lamination process.
    This will be easier, but also doesn't have as defined layers. Croissants go great with chocolate sauce, or slice them open and add ham and egg inside!

   Melon pan is a popular bread in east Asian countries, where they're popular due to their melon-shaped appearance and sweet flavor.
   The bread has a sweet crackling on top of it which is scored to give the impression of a melon. While they take more work to make than a white bread, their unique appearance is bound to be popular.
   If you ever need to impress someone with your baking skills, try bringing them some melon pan to eat!
